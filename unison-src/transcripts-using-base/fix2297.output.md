This tests a case where a function was somehow discarding abilities.


```unison
ability Trivial where
  trivial : ()

-- This handler SHOULD leave any additional effects alone and unhandled
handleTrivial : '{e, Trivial} a -> {e} a
handleTrivial action = 
  h : Request {Trivial} a -> a
  h = cases
    {trivial -> resume} -> handle !resume with h
    {a} -> a
  handle !action with h

testAction : '{Exception, IO, Trivial} ()
testAction _ =
  printText "hi!"
  trivial

wat : ()
wat =  handleTrivial testAction -- Somehow this completely forgets about Exception and IO

> handleTrivial testAction
```

  I found a value  of type:  Either Failure Unit
  where I expected to find:  Unit
  
     15 |   printText "hi!"
     16 |   trivial
  
  Hint: Actions within a block must have type Unit.
        Use _ = <expr> to ignore a result.
