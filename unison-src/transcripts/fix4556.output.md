  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar.hello : Nat
      foo.hello : Nat
      hey       : Nat
      thing     : Nat

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    bar.hello : Nat
    foo.hello : Nat
    hey       : Nat
    thing     : Nat

```
```unison
thing = 2
```

```ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      thing : Nat

```
```ucm
.> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  hey : Nat
  hey = hello
  
  foo.hello : Nat
  foo.hello =
    use Nat +
    5 + thing
  
  bar.hello : Nat
  bar.hello =
    use Nat +
    5 + thing
  
  thing = 2

  Typechecking failed. I've updated your scratch file with the
  definitions that need fixing. Once the file is compiling, try
  `update` again.
