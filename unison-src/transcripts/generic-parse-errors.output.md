Just a bunch of random parse errors to test the error formatting.

```unison
x = 
  foo.123
```

```ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:
  
      2 |   foo.123
  
  
  I was surprised to find a 1 here.
  I was hoping for one of these instead:
  
  * end of input
  * hash (ex: #af3sj3)
  * identifier (ex: abba1, snake_case, .foo.bar#xyz, .foo.++#xyz, or ðŸŒ»)

```
```unison
namespace.blah = 1
```

```ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  The identifier used here isn't allowed to be a reserved keyword: 
  
      1 | namespace.blah = 1
  

```
```unison
x = 1 ]
```

```ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found a closing ']' here without a matching '['.
  
      1 | x = 1 ]
  

```
```unison
x = a.#abc
```

```ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:
  
      1 | x = a.#abc
  
  
  I was surprised to find a '.' here.

```
```unison
x = "hi
```

```ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:
  
      2 | 
  
  I was surprised to find an end of input here.
  I was hoping for one of these instead:
  
  * "
  * \s
  * literal character

```
```unison
y : a 
```

```ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:
  
      2 | 
  
  I was surprised to find an end of section here.
  I was hoping for one of these instead:
  
  * ->
  * newline or semicolon

```
