# Inability to reference a term or type with a name that has segments starting with an underscore

There should be no issue having terms with an underscore-led component

``` unison
_a.blah = 2

b = _a.blah + 1
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I couldn't figure out what .blah refers to here:
  
      3 | b = _a.blah + 1
  
  I also don't know what type it should be.
  
  Some common causes of this error include:
    * Your current namespace is too deep to contain the
      definition in its subtree
    * The definition is part of a library which hasn't been
      added to this project
    * You have a typo in the name
