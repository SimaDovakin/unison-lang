##### This transcript reproduces the failure to unlink documentation

```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

Step 1: code a term and documentation for it
```unison
x = 1
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x:]
```

Step 2: add term and documentation, link, and check the documentation
```ucm
.trunk> add
.trunk> link x.doc x
.trunk> docs x
```

Step 2.5: We'll save this for later for some reason.
```ucm
.trunk> alias.term x.doc .backup.x.doc
```

Step 3: Oops I don't like the doc, so I will re-code it!
```unison
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x, and I now look better:]
```

Step 4: I add it and expect to see it
```ucm
.trunk> update
.trunk> docs x
```

That works great. Let's relink the old doc too.

```ucm
.trunk> link .backup.x.doc x
```

Let's check that we see both docs:

```ucm
.trunk> docs x
```
