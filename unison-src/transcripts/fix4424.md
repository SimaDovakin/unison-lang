```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

Some basics:

```unison:hide
unique type Cat.Dog = Mouse Nat
unique type Rat.Dog = Bird

countCat = cases
  Cat.Dog.Mouse x -> Bird
```

```ucm
.> add
```

Now I want to add a constructor.

```unison:hide
unique type Rat.Dog = Bird | Mouse
```

```ucm:error
.> update
```

Here's the code that `update` produced:

```unison:error
countCat : Cat.Dog -> Rat.Dog
countCat = cases Mouse x -> Bird

unique type Rat.Dog = Bird | Mouse
```

Okay, hmm. TBH I think this code should have type-checked without user intervention, but the way it printed (`cases Mouse x`) is ambiguous, and UCM assumed `Mouse` meant `Rat.Dog.Mouse` instead of `Cat.Dog.Mouse`, which caused parsing to fail.

I'll fix it by making it explicit:

```unison
countCat : Cat.Dog -> Rat.Dog
countCat = cases Cat.Dog.Mouse x -> Bird

unique type Rat.Dog = Bird | Mouse
```

Ok, all set! Now let's update.

```ucm:error
.> update
```

Why is it still printing just `Mouse` and failing?
