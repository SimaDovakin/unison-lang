When using `delete.namespace` ucm will not assign `numberedArgs` which is unexpected.

It also assigns multiple things to the same number (possibly related).

## Transcript showing the problem

First, lets create two namespaces. `foo` and `bar`, and add some definitions.

```unison
x = 42
y = 100
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      x : Nat
      y : Nat

```
```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace .foo is empty.

.foo> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    x : Nat
    y : Nat

```
```unison
z = x + y
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      z : Nat

```
```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace .bar is empty.

.bar> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    z : Nat

```
Let's see what we have created...
```ucm
.> ls

  1. bar/     (1 definition)
  2. builtin/ (168 definitions)
  3. foo/     (2 definitions)

```
Now, if we try deleting the namespace `foo`, we get an error, as expected.

```ucm
.> delete.namespace foo

  ⚠️
  
  I couldn't delete
  
    1. foo.x : builtin.Nat
    2. foo.y : builtin.Nat
    
  
  because it's still being used by these definitions:
  
    1. bar.z : builtin.Nat
    

```
However, the numbered arguments are not assigned by that command.
```ucm
.> debug.numberedArgs

  1. .bar
  2. .builtin
  3. .foo

```
As you can see, the earlier output from `ls is still there.
