test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main lib.base_latest

  The use of `pull` to install libraries is now deprecated.
  Going forward, you can use
  `lib.install @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main`.

  Downloaded 2 entities.

  I installed @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main as
  aryairani_test_almost_empty_main.

test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main a.b

  Sorry, I wasnâ€™t sure how to process your request. I think
  you're wanting to merge @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main into
  the a.b namespace, but the `pull` command only supports
  merging into the top level of a local project branch.

test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main a

  I think you're wanting to merge
  @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main into the a branch, but it
  doesn't exist. If you want, you can create it with
  `branch.empty a`, and then `pull` again.
