test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main lib.base_latest

  The use of `pull` to install libraries is now deprecated.
  Going forward, you can use
  `lib.install @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main`.

  Downloaded 2 entities.

  I installed @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main as
  aryairani_test_almost_empty_main.

test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main a.b

  I think you're wanting to merge
  @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main into the a.b namespace, but
  the `pull` command only supports merging into the top level of
  a local project branch.
  
  Use `help pull` to see some examples.

test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main a

  I think you're wanting to merge
  @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main into the a branch, but it
  doesn't exist. If you want, you can create it with
  `branch.empty a`, and then `pull` again.

test/main> pull @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main .a

  I think you're wanting to merge
  @aryairani/test-almost-empty/main into the .a namespace, but
  the `pull` command only supports merging into the top level of
  a local project branch.
  
  Use `help pull` to see some examples.
