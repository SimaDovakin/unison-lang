```unison
lib.dep0.bonk.foo = 5
lib.dep0.zonk.foo = "hi"
lib.dep0.lib.dep1.foo = 6
myterm = foo + 2
```

```ucm

  I couldn't find any definitions matching the name foo inside the namespace .
  
      4 | myterm = foo + 2
  
  Some common causes of this error include:
    * Your current namespace is too deep to contain the
      definition in its subtree
    * The definition is part of a library which hasn't been
      added to this project
  
  To add a library to this project use the command: `fork <.path.to.lib> .lib.<libname>`
  
  Whatever it is, its type should conform to Nat.
  
  I found some terms in scope that have matching names and types. Maybe you meant one of these:
  
    - lib.dep0.bonk.foo : Nat
    - lib.dep0.lib.dep1.foo : Nat
