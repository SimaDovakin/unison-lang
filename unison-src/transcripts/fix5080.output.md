    2. Write some Unison code and save the file.
    3. In UCM, type `add` to save it to your new project.

  🎉 🥳 Happy coding!

test> fix5080.tests.success = check (6 Nat.== 6)
test> fix5080.tests.failure = check (2 Nat.== 4)
```

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:

      fix5080.tests.failure : [Result]
      fix5080.tests.success : [Result]

  Now evaluating any watch expressions (lines starting with
  `>`)... Ctrl+C cancels.

    1 | test> fix5080.tests.success = check (6 Nat.== 6)

    ✅ Passed Passed

    2 | test> fix5080.tests.failure = check (2 Nat.== 4)

    🚫 FAILED Failed

```
```ucm
test-5080/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
